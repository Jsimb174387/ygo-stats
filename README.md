# ygo-stats

Ygoprodeck.com scraper to get deck information. Run main.py with python to get started: This will scrape ygoprodeck.com with Firefox, pulling all deck lists from the past 50 tournament's top cut that are on Ygoprodeck, sorting that data into [example deck].csv and giving you data on ratios and how many people play certain card (for example, if you ever wondered "how many branded despia decks are on ash", you can find data for that). These csv files are found in deckStats.
